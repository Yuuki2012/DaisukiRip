This program redirects all traffic through DaisukiRip.exe which makes it able to capture the subtitles
This "redirecting" can cause certain programs/websites to fail loading.

Note: if the proxy ever refuses to un-register itself from the system, run 'Reset proxy settings.reg', and everything will work fine again.

Changelog:
v0.0.0.4
- Required to run as admin because of the proxy settings, writing to registery requires administrator rights...
- Improved URL parsing.

v0.0.0.3
- Catching captions URL now uses Regex.
- Should now properly shutdown the proxy instead of keeping it in memory :^)

v0.0.0.2
- Fixed issue with SSL websites.
